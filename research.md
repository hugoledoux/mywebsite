# Research projects

## Validation & automatic repair of geo-datasets

Recently, out of frustration at the poor quality of GIS datasets and of 3D city models I obtained, I have focussed my efforts on the validation and the *automatic* repair of polygons and polyhedra. This has lead to different [programmes](/code) that have matured enough to not be called prototypes anymore. I hope these will help practitioners who often spend hundreds of hours manually repairing and improving their datasets. 

I offer some of the programmes as [web-applications](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl).

## Higher-dimensional modelling of geoinformation

The aim of the research project is to integrate the multi-dimensional characteristics of geographical data, ie 2D/3D, time and scale, together in one higher-dimensional model. We develop data structures and operations to construct such models, and we validate them by integrating CityGML models at different scales for instance.

This research project is funded by Vidi grant from the [Dutch Technology Foundation STW](http://www.stw.nl) awarded to [Jantien Stoter](http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter).
