I read blogs every day. 
About everything and nothing (eg [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org)), about technology ([Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net), [Guardian tech](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog)), about GIS ([Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/), [Sean Gillies](http://sgillies.net/blog/), [Lin.ear th.inking](http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.nl), [Just Objects](http://justobjects.nl/writings/blog/)), about the wonderful world that is academia ([Guardian's Academics Anonymous](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/series/academics-anonymous)).

Blogs are one of my main sources of information, and I've learned a lot of interesting things over the years.
Also, when I search for the solution to a particular technical problem, I often find the solution in a blog.
Someone somewhere had the same problem and wrote her solution.
Which solves *my* problem. Great.

So today I'm starting mine. 
I plan to write about and reflect on different sides of my job.
I'll write about the tools I use daily (PostGIS, Python, QGIS, LaTeX, etc.), about being an academic, about how I used/crunched/analysed a particular datasets, about getting published, etc. 
Oh, and I also plan to use this tribune to explain to everyone what is so wrong with CityGML[^1]. 

Welcome to my blog, hope you'll enjoy it.


[^1]: just joking, CityGML is great!
