I am an associate-professor in the [3D geoinformation research group](http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) at the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl) in the Netherlands.

I hold a [PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}/phdthesis) in computer science from the [University of South Wales](http://www.southwales.ac.uk) in the UK, and a BSc in Geomatics Engineering from the [Université Laval](http://www.ulaval.ca) in Québec City, Canada.

For my research, I am particularly interested in combining the fields of GIS and computational geometry. 
Put simply, I often try to solve geographical problems---either in 2D or in 3D---by first decomposing the world into triangles/tetrahedra or into another tessellation such as the Voronoi diagram. 
My work involves developing topological data structures to store these tessellations, and designing algorithms to analyse and extract information from the datasets. 
I strongly believe in implementing my research ideas, the source code of my projects is freely available under open-source licences ([overview of my projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/software)).

I am on the editorial board of two new journals that promote open source software: [The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/) and [Open Geospatial Data, Software and Standards](https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/).

I am currently working, among others, on storing efficiently 3D city models with [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org), on the [reconstruction of massive TINS](https://github.com/hugoledoux/sst/), the [validation and the automatic repair of polygons and polyhedra as found in GIS](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl), the [semantic classification of urban textured meshes](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/meshannotation/), and the [higher-dimensional modelling of geographical information](http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/umnd/) (ie 4D+).

Teaching-wise, I am involved in the courses [*Digital terrain modelling*](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1015/) and [*3D modelling of the built environments*](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1004/) (both courses are open, with YouTube videos and open-access books) in the [MSc Geomatics programme](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) at TU Delft.
For some years already, I've been using only free and open-source software for the labs, eg [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/), [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio), [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), etc.
