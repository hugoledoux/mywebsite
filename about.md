I am an assistant-professor in the [GIS technology group](http://www.gdmc.nl) of the [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl). I hold a [PhD](#phdthesis) in computer science from the [University of South Wales](http://www.southwales.ac.uk) in the UK, and a BSc in geomatics engineering from the [Université Laval](http://www.ulaval.ca) in Québec City, Canada.

For my research, I am particularly interested in combining the fields of GIS and computational geometry. Put simply, I often try to solve geographical problems---either in 2D or in 3D---by first decomposing the world into triangles or into another tessellation such as the Voronoi diagram. My work involves developing topological data structures to store these tessellations, and designing algorithms to analyse and extract information from the datasets. I strongly believe in implementing my research ideas, and for most of my projects prototypes are built. 

Recently, out of frustration at the poor quality of GIS datasets and of 3D city models I obtained, I have focussed my efforts on the validation and the automatic repair of polygons and polyhedra. This has lead to different [programmes](#code) that have (almost) matured enough to not be called prototypes anymore. 

Part of my current research is about [higher-dimensional modelling of geographical information](http://www.geo5d.nl) (ie 4D+). My colleagues and I aim at integrating into the same model the three spatial dimensions with extra ones, for instance time and scale, modelled as geometric ones. We design data structures and algorithms to construct and manipulate higher-dimensional models, and we validate our concept by constructing models of a city for instance.

Teaching-wise, I am the responsible lecturer for the course "Geographical Information Systems and Cartography" in the [MSc Geomatics programme](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) at TU Delft. For some years already, I've been using only free and open-source software for the labs, eg [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/), [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/), [Shapely](https://github.com/sgillies/shapely) (the Python-bindings for [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)), and [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/).
