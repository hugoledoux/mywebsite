That's the total number of points in the [AHN2 dataset](http://www.ahn.nl) (the height model of the Netherlands, *Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland* in Dutch), my colleague [Ravi Peters](http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/rypeters/) counted them.

That's *a lot* of points.

According to a presentation given at the [ELMF conference](http://www.lidarmap.org/europe/) last month, that is 987GB in [LAZ](http://www.laszip.org) (thus compressed), and 11.6TB uncompressed.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>630 billion points of Dutch National <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiDAR?src=hash">#LiDAR</a> survey AHN2 are 1 TB in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAZ?src=hash">#LAZ</a> but 12 TB in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAS?src=hash">#LAS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELMF?src=hash">#ELMF</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPAREU?src=hash">#SPAREU</a> <a href="http://t.co/B2KpSYtg7C">pic.twitter.com/B2KpSYtg7C</a></p>&mdash; Martin Isenburg (@LAStools) <a href="https://twitter.com/LAStools/status/542268499851509761">December 9, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And the AHN2 elevation points have only the (*x, y, z*) coordinates (in [EPSG:28992](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/amersfoort-rd-new/)), no other attributes are available (eg RGB values, first-last returns, intensity, etc).

The total area of the Netherlands is 41,543km<sup>2</sup>, thus we have 15.4 points/m<sup>2</sup>; and that ignores water where there is often no returns.


## Classification of the points

The AHN2 dataset is already classified:

| classification                                 | # of points     |
| --------------                                 |:---------------:|
| bare-earth (*gefilterd*)                       | 168,781,835,404 |
| man-made objects + vegetation (*uitgefilterd*) | 470,695,874,217 |
| **total**                                      | 639,477,709,621 |


## AHN2 is tiled

A few years ago, I obtained the dataset in tiles of 1000mX1250m; there were ~30,000 of them.

Now, for reasons that I ignore, from the government website ([PDOK](https://www.pdok.nl)) the tiles are bigger (5km X 6.25km), and there are 1,372 of them:

Each tile is rather big, for instance for the one where my office is:

| tile | classification | # of points | size (LAZ) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 37en2 | ground | 367,517,644 | 431MB |
| 37en2 | man-made | 157,259,896 | 440MB |


## Downloading the elevation points

The good news is that the dataset is open and publicly available. 
The bad news, is that the official way to download the points is rather convoluted.
For instance, to see in 3D my [office building](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/contact-and-accessibility/housing-tu-delft/accessibility/building-8/):

1. find the tile number, get WMS to get tile name, get WMS of base map to locate our building
3. find download links in the Atom feed of PDOK
4. download the two files (gefiltered and uitgefiltered)
5. combine them to view the building an its surrounding

the LAZ files are zipped, there's no reason for that.
