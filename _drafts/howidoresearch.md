## Use a reference manager

  - jabref/mendeley 
  - write down summary in your own words
  - give keywords
  - key is Smith17


## Keep the annotated PDF you read

  - the ipad is *great*
  - can scan paper


## How to find recent papers?

  - google scholar for recent papers
  - find a recent review paper
  - find a PhD thesis, the related work section is usually more complete than that of a paper

[x] And also be very critical because a lot of research papers are crap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, you should know better than just accept what is written as true
[x] scihub (on telegram)
[x] put your source LaTeX on Git, you won‚Äôt regret it
[x] I still use paper to think and write, I really do
[x] figures: make an effort to have them vector
[x] Stuck? Go for a walk or bike ride
[x] it‚Äôs not a sprint, it‚Äôs a marathon
[x] If it feels daunting and tiresome: You‚Äôre not alone, it‚Äôs meant to be this way üò¨


This is your project, not your supervisor's.
Which means you are in charge of the planning and the progress, your supervisor is there to help you succeed.

No dependencies. Avoid dependencies on third parties. Such parties
intend well, yet reality is often different from expectations. Do not become
the victim of this and make sure you have full control. E.g.: Promised
datasets, experts, constraints, or other agreements have to be there before
you start.

Criticism shouldn't be taken as a personal attack.

Try to solve well a single topic, instead of solving a bit of a very broad topic

I don't know exactly what you should be doing, if I knew you wouldn't be working on this. We will meet to find what to do next.

Writing takes a lot of time
