I the spirit of [the Setup](https://usesthis.com) and [How I Work](http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work), here's a list of the software I use for carrying out my research in (3D) GIS.

## Hardware?

In the last 10 years, I've moved from Windows, to Linux, to now using Mac OS X.
I have only one computer, a MacBook Pro 15" Retina with 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM, and I use an external 24" monitor and an [external keyboard](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa) and [trackpad](https://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/), both at home (where I often work) and in the office.

I used to have other computers, iMacs, but maintaining my setup and configurations on different was taking way too much time. 
One computer is way more efficient and simpler.

## Backing up?

I have had 2 hard-drive failures in my life, one was rather dramatic: at the end of a semester at the university while I was following 7 courses. 
I lost *everything* (but still succeeding in passing the semester).
So I'm now rather obsessed with backing up.

  * All the code I write is in __[GitHub](https://github.com/hugoledoux/)__, many of it is private first, when it's in a serious state it's release under an open-source licence.
  * While the GitHub Desktop program is fine, I find that __[Tower](http://www.git-tower.com)__ is much more powerful (eg it allows searching commits), and branching, reverting and other git commands are easy to grasp (before Tower, git on the command line was one big scary thing for me, now I wouldn't work without it).
  * Most other documents are in __[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)__, and I pay an annual subscription. It's expensive, but Dropbox has *never* failed me once in 5 years, which is worth a lot of money in my opinion.
  * I backup everyday my computer to a __[Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Mac_OS))__ at home, so if a disaster happens I should be fine.


## GIS software

  * __[QGIS](http://qgis.org)__ is my 'daily GIS'. I started using it in 2007, and back then you really had to stubborn to use it, because it was incomplete and buggy. But nowadays, it is stable, fast, simple and I don't feel that those using [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com) have an advantage (quite the opposite).
  * __[FME](http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/)__ is my other GIS (while FME doesn't label itself as a GIS for strategic reasons, it is one). QGIS is pretty primitive for 3D and CityGML, and that's where FME compensates. Just to be able to visualise CityGML file properly in 3D under a Mac, it is worth it.


## Writing 

I prefer to use LaTeX for writing, and will do pretty much anything to avoid using Word.

  * __[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)__ with the __[LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools)__ is pretty much the perfect LaTeX environment. My only quibble is that there is no option to see the table of content of a paper (a nice option with TextMate).
  * __[IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org)__ is great for drawing anything where geometries are involved. It creates figures directly in PDF (so no need to maintain 2 files), and one can write directly in LaTeX formulas. It's also extensible, and [the CGAL ipelets are easy to install]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/ipe-cgal-ipelets/).
  * while I'm still a dummy with __[Blender](http://www.blender.org)__, I'm trying to use it more and more to produce nice figures in 3D. 
  * this blog/website is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and its [source code is freely available](https://github.com/hugoledoux/mywebsite).
  * I write blog posts and other small bits in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and use __[Marked 2](http://marked2app.com)__ to preview it (the features to check if the URLs are valid is very useful).


## Presenting

  * Keynote
  * Beamer
  * Caffeine when presenting

## Miscellaneous 

  * NotationalVelocity
  * Noiz.io
  * atext
  * Annotate (printscreen annotated, very well done)
  * Forklift (I don't know how can someone works with Finder and without a dual-panel)
  * 1password
  * FluidApp (for webapp that I use often (eg gmail), different cache)
  * Jumpcut


* sublime text for latex, Python. C++
* xcode
