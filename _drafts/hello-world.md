With this blog post, I guess I can say that I am now a blogger. I've been reading blogs for years about different topics, 

learned a lot about many topics

and often find solutions to my technical problems in blogs of others (by googling).

mention which blogs I like

What took me so long? I don't know. Lazyness perhaps.

So I am starting this blog perhaps mostly for myself, ie I plan to describe solutions I found to particular problems related to using/crunching/analysing (3D) GIS datasets.

I also plan to use this tribune to explain at length what is so wrong with CityGML (my love-hate relationships with CityGML)

Discuss the tools I use as a researchers (eg LaTeX, PostGIS, QGIS, Python-Shapely)
