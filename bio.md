## Not so long version

Hugo Ledoux is an associate-professor in 3D geographical information systems (GIS) at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Glamorgan (Cardiff, UK) and a BSc in geomatics engineering from the Université Laval (Québec City, Canada). For his research, he is particularly interested in combining the fields of GIS and computational geometry. He often tries to solve geographical problems--either in 2D or in 3D--by first decomposing the world into triangles/tetrahedra or into another tessellation such as the Voronoi diagram. His work involves developing topological data structures to store these tessellations, and designing algorithms to analyse and extract information from the datasets. He strongly believes in implementing his research ideas. He is currently working on the validation and the automatic repair of polygons and polyhedra as found in GIS, the higher-dimensional modelling of geographical information (ie 4D+), and the smart simplification of LiDAR datasets.
